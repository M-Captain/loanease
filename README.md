## üí∞ Loan Repayment Optimization App ‚Äì Project Description

### üìå **Overview**
This project is a Python-based financial tool that helps individuals or families efficiently **repay multiple loans** using different strategies. It simulates various **debt repayment methods**‚Äîincluding <br>**Snowball**, **Avalanche**, **Dynamic**, and **AI-Optimized (Linear Programming)**‚Äîto determine the most effective way to **minimize interest paid** and **clear debts faster**.<br>

---

### üéØ **Objectives**
- Track and manage multiple loans with different balances, interest rates, and minimum payments.<br>
- Implement multiple debt repayment strategies:<br>
  - **Debt Snowball Method**<br>
  - **Debt Avalanche Method**<br>
  - **Dynamic Allocation Strategy**<br>
  - **AI-Optimized Payment Strategy (via Linear Programming)**<br>
- Compare the effectiveness of each method by analyzing:<br>
  - Time taken to repay all loans.<br>
  - Total interest paid.<br>
  - Interest saved vs. other methods.<br>

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used**<br>
- **Python**: Core language for all calculations and logic.<br>
- **SciPy**: Used for linear programming in the AI-Optimized method.<br>
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Each loan is modeled as a class instance.<br>
- **Django + SQLite** *(Optional for integration)*: Can be used to store loan data and display progress in a web interface.<br>

---

### üß† **Key Features**
- **User-defined loan input**: Add your own loan details (balance, interest, min payment).<br>
- **Flexible budget allocation**: Set how much you can afford to repay monthly.<br>
- **Real-time loan updates**: Simulate payments monthly and view remaining balances.<br>
- **Interest calculation**: Monthly compounding of interest on remaining balances.<br>
- **AI-based optimization**: Allocate payments to minimize interest using Linear Programming.<br>
- **Comparison of Methods**: Quantitative proof of which method saves the most money.<br>

### üìä **Strategy Comparison (Sample Output)**
| Method        | Months to Clear | Total Interest Paid | Interest Saved |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Snowball      | 38              | $5,200               | -              |
| Avalanche     | 35              | $4,650               | $550           |
| Dynamic       | 34              | $4,300               | $900           |
| AI-Optimized  | 33              | $4,000               | $1,200         |

### üßÆ **Mathematical Concepts Involved**
- **Compound interest**<br>
- **Budget constraint optimization**<br>
- **Linear programming (LP)**<br>
- **Greedy and heuristic algorithms**<br>
- **Debt prioritization logic**<br>

---

### üìà **Possible Extensions**
- Build a **Django web interface** to enter loans and view graphs.<br>
- Add **data persistence** using SQLite or PostgreSQL.<br>
- Include **charts (e.g., Matplotlib or Chart.js)** for visual comparison.<br>
- Export reports as **PDFs or CSVs**.<br>
- Add **email reminders** for upcoming payments.<br>

---

### ‚úÖ **Use Cases**
- Individuals juggling **student loans, credit cards, and car loans**.<br>
- Financial literacy education for students or households.<br>
- Budgeting tools or fintech applications that want to provide **personalized debt payoff plans**.<br>
